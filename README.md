### Team Project: Developing and testing a CES device simulator

The goal of this project is to develop and test a simulator for embedded software used in Cranial 
Electrical Stimulation (CES) devices similar to the Alpha-Stim and OasisPro products described 
below.  
 
A CES device is a non-invasive neuro-stimulation medical device that delivers microcurrent via 
an electrode through the earlobes to stimulate the brain for the purpose of therapeutic 
intervention
